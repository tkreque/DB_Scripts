This scripts has been created by me, friends and collect on the Internet, I never bothored in add the source of the script before because I only use for some specific case, and now I regret this behaviour :).

So if you have some script in this collection and I didn't put any credits, please let me know so I can adjust.
Or if you have some script in this collection and you want removed, please let me know so I can remove.
